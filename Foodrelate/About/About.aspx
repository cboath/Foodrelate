         <h3>About this site</h3>
         <p>This site was created in 2013 in a web development class I was taking.  The idea for the site I had for quite a while because we
         would always be home after a long day of work and see that we had a chuck roast thawed or a bunch of chicken breasts.  We would 
         debate for a while over what to make with what we had on hand.  I figured if we could have a way to keep track of our favorite 
         recipes this would be an ideal way to make the dinner decision a bit easier.</p>
